When you join a new team, create a `memories` folder for it.
Then, any time something memorable happens — cool demo, feature launch, funny GitHub issue, ...  — grab a screenshot and stick it into `memories`.

When you feel demotivated or unconfident, take a peek at your `memories`.
Seeing those victories will help you **remember that you are awesome**.

You're so awesome in fact that you probably deserve a raise!
Luckily, your `memories` is also a list of your achievements,
so call on them when you **negotiate that promotion** with your boss.

Finally, when it's time for you to move on to your next thing,
**write a kickass goodbye email** where you share your favorite `memories`.
