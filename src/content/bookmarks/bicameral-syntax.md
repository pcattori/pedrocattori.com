When working on a new programming language, start with a tree-like abstract syntax (ala Lisp).
That lets you immediately get to work on the interesting semantics of your language.
Only after that have you earned the right to layer on syntax.

> Syntax is a view.

You can even add multiple syntaxes as "views" on top your abstract syntax.
